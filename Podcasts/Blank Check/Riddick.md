### Advanced Settings:
- The unrated cut can be used with advanced settings, either removing the extra scenes from the movie (doesn't cut cleanly and leaves in a few extra frames) or padding out the podcast (will have sections with no commentary around where the deleted scenes take place).

  - [Pitch Black - Unrated Pod Edit.json](Settings/Pitch%20Black%20-%20Unrated%20Pod%20Edit.json)
### Notes:
- Theatrical Cut (even though they say it's the Unrated Director's Cut)
- They restart the movie towards the beginning after the initial countdown
  - The start timecode accounts for this
- Strangely, the UHD disc with the theatrical cut is 24fps instead of 23.976, so it slowly gets out of sync with the Roku version they watched
